# S4-Sprint1-Server
Mitchell Barkley, Natalina Chiarot, Lauren Wilson

A Java server which tracks cities, airports, passengers, aircraft, and the flights involving them.
Data creation and retrieval is performed through a REST API. The data is kept in memory, and will be lost when the server is shut down.

The server's main method is located in com.s4sprint1.server.ServerApplication. Once the server is running, the example data can be loaded by running /DataFunction.js

The repository for the Client side of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/natchiarot/S4-Sprint1-Client/).
